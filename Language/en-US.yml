      STR_COUNTER_TERRORISM_ALERT_DESCRIPTION: A member of the Security Council has requested our support in a Counter-Terrorism Operation. Heavy resistance is expected. Unknown number of hostages.
      STR_HOSTAGE_CRISIS: Hostage Crisis
      STR_HOSTAGE_CRISIS_BRIEFING: A hostage crisis is taking place in an office complex owned by a Security Council member government. A group of Terrorists have barricaded themselves inside the complex and taken prisoner the government personnel. Our mission is to storm the building, neutralize the terrorists and rescue the hostages alive.  A Mi-8 helicopter from an allied country has been loaned to us for this operation, some of our troops will fast-rope from it, while some other will assault the building from the lower floors. After descending from the helicopter our troops cannot return to it and evacuation will become infeasible.
      STR_HIJACKED_PLANE: Hijacked Plane Assault
      STR_HIJACKED_PLANE_BRIEFING: A civilian plane has been hijacked by a group of terrorists. The extremists are demanding the release of their comrades held in prisons in the country where we will be deployed, as well as safe passage to escape. We cannot allow that. The aircraft is parked on a runway at the local airport. Our mission will be to storm the plane, neutralize the hostiles and avoid civilian casualties at all costs. Extreme caution, it's a closed environment and a stray bullet could injure someone.
      STR_HUMAN_TERROR_ATTACK: Terrorist Attack
      STR_URBAN_TERROR_BRIEFING: A squad of terrorists has started an attack on a city and we have been called upon to support the local authorities. The reason for the assault is not known, but there is speculation that the enemy is trying to make a show of force, perhaps directed at members of other anarchist groups. There are no hostages, but chaos reigns in the streets. It is our mission to support the local forces in restoring order, neutralizing the hostiles and ensuring the safety of civilians, before the attack escalates and gets out of control.
      STR_TERRORIST_HQ_MARKER: "Terrorist Hideout"
      STR_TERRORIST_HQ_FOUND: "Terrorist Hideout Found"
      STR_TERRORIST_HQ_BRIEFING: "Intelligence has confirmed that this building is the source of the alien weaponry. The number of individuals inside is unknown, but is estimated at between 20 and 30. Your objective is to clear out the building and either capture or neutralize whoever is in charge of the cell. Speed and discretion is essential, as we do not want to draw unwanted attention from the public to the operation"
      STR_TERRORIST_HQ_RAID: "Terrorist Hideout Raid"

      STR_GOOD_ENDING_1: "After breaching through the depths of the alien command center, our troops we able to destroy the Brain, a supercomputer used by the aliens to coordinate efforts on Earth. A nuclear attack from orbit happened right after our troops left the facility, negating the enemy the possibility of retrieving any artifacts or data. No known alien survivors are reported."
      STR_GOOD_ENDING_2: "Other UN-led forces around the planet report similar success on their designated objectives. There is still heavy resistance, but we have crippled their military forces and they are routed."
      STR_GOOD_ENDING_3: "Operation Downfall meant the beginning of the colonization of the space. Human spaceships are built, meant to reach the planets and moons on the Solar System. A dream that was impossible a decade ago. The power of the atom, instead of destroying the Mankind, has propel us to the stars and beyond."
      STR_GOOD_ENDING_4: "Mars is still a contested planet. Estimations expect our troops to be outmatched in 10 to 1. But this won't be a stop to our campaign, as new scientific and military vessels are prepared to arrive to the Red Planet and establish a firm foothold. The War for Mars has begun."

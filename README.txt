United Nations Extraterrestrial Combat Command mod by IDT


Inspiration:

This compilation was inspired by several sources. One of the main ones, as well as my reference source is the work of Hobbes
in Area 51 and even more in Tech-Com, where I copied several codes. It's my favorite mod of one of my favorite movies. Back in 2015, I played a modified version by myself
of the Equal Terms mod in which XCOM troops used United Nations equipment. Unfortunately, those games were
lost, as my old PC. I was recently watching the movie The Siege of Jadotville and another source of inspiration emerged
of this project, a force of the Blue Helmets fighting against aliens in the Cold War. Xenonauts is also inspiration
of this compilation, for some concepts and part of its graphics, although it is not an attempt to copy that game.
